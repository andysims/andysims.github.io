  <h1>Andy Sims - Personal Home Page</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Who I Am</h3>
  <p>I am passionate about simplifying life. At home, this means cherishing time spent with family, focusing on what matters. While at work, it's important to me that tasks are simple, and if they aren't, I take it upon myself to make them so. If you'd like to learn more about me see my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>, <a href="projects.html">projects</a> I've complete or are in progress, or a bit longer <a href="bio.html">bio</a>.</p>
  <p>I currently work as a GIS Analyst/Programmer at a small consulting firm, but enjoy working on personal projects. Being such a big user in Open Source GIS, I plan to start contributing code and developing plug-ins for software, such as QGIS.</p>
