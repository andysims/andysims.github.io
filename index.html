  <h1>Andy Sims - Personal Home Page</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Who I Am</h3>
  <p>I am passionate about simplifying life. At home, this means cherishing time spent with family, focusing on what matters. While at work, it's important to me that tasks are simple, and if they aren't, I take it upon myself to make them so. If you'd like to learn more about me see my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> or check out some completed and on-going <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, or a brief <a href="bio.html">bio</a>.</p>
  <p>I currently work as a GIS Analyst/Programmer at a small consulting firm, but enjoy working on personal projects. Being such a big user of Open Source, I plan to start contributing more to projects and developing plug-ins, especially for QGIS, in addition to tools for ArcGIS.</p>
