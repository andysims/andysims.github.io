  <h3>Current</h3>
  <p>I am currently working as a <abbr title="Geographic Information Systems">GIS</abbr> Analyst and Programmer at a small consulting firm. Much of my time is spent writing Python and SQL scripts to automate geospatial and data processing tasks. I also administer multiple cities geodatabases and GIS layers. A few projects I'm proud of completing include building-out water and sewage systems for cities utilizing GPS, As-Builts, and GIS software.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Previous Work</h3>
  <p>Previous positions include interning in GIS departments at the Cities of Berkeley and Pasadena. My time was spent developing web map applications, creating, maintaining, and updating GIS data and maps. I've been fortunate to work with many departments throughout the Cities to determine GIS needs. </p>
