  <h1>Andy Sims - Projects</h1>
  <p>(Go back to my <a href="index.html">personal home page.</a>)</p>
  <h3>In Progress</h3>
  <p>Here are some things that are in the works, both as personal projects and at my current position:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Under construction...</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Previous Projects</h3>
  <p>I can't show all of my projects because much of what I do involves sensitve client data.
  <br>Though, I can provide some general overview on ones I'm proud of accomplishing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automation <i>(I will continue to add more projects)</i></li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/andysims/Work/blob/master/Eckersall/DataProcessing/py/exportCensusKMZs.py">Export Census KMZs</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Python script that: Reads and compares nationwide census blocks (Postgres) to client's eligible blocks (CSV). Generates directories for each state. Grabs county fips codes to generate names of KMZ files (ex: CA_LosAngeles.kmz). Using ArcPy, I setup the MXD, set definition queries hitting tables in Postgres, which then spits out a KMZ file for all counties in the U.S. where eligible.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/andysims/Work/blob/master/Eckersall/DataProcessing/py/studyAreasKMZ.py">Export Study Area KMZs</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Python script that: Reads incoming CSV file of companies and their study areas to generate KMZ files. Use ArcPy to set definition query, hit Postgres tables, then exports  a KMZ file for each company.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/andysims/Work/blob/master/Eckersall/DataProcessing/py/studyAreasProcessedCheck.py">Study Area Check</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Runs through directory to ensure each company successfully had a KMZ exported.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>City of Sierra Madre</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Water System</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Field GPS collection of all features (hydrants, valves, meters, etc.).</li>
        <li>Use of as-built plans, and whatever else available to draw in mains and laterals.</li>
        <li>Delivered GIS data.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>City of Norwalk</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Water System</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Field GPS collection of all features (hydrants, valves, meters, etc.).</li>
        <li>Use of as-built plans, and whatever else available to draw in mains and laterals.</li>
        <li>Delivered map books in addition to GIS data.</li>
        <br>
      </ul>
      <li>Sewer System</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Dodging cars to collect manhole locations with GPS.</li>
        <li>Use of engineering plans to draw in sewer mains.</li>
